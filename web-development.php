                  We start with a simple, friendly chat. You’ll be paired with your very own project manager who will walk you through every step of the process. We’ll ask questions about your business, your goals, and your audience, and we’ll explore any specific styles or designs you have in mind. Whether you have inspiration from other sites or ideas about colors and layouts, we want to hear it all. Your dedicated project manager will always be just an email or Zoom call away for any tweaks or questions as we move forward.

                  Once we know your vision, our team will begin planning a tailored strategy to bring your site to life. You’ll receive an initial layout or wireframe to help guide the design, but it’s not set in stone. Think of it as a foundation—a starting point we can refine together. You’ll have full flexibility to evolve the design, ensuring the site reflects your brand perfectly as we move through the process.

                  Now for the fun part! Our designers create custom designs in Figma that are entirely unique to your brand—no cookie-cutter templates here. We avoid outdated, poorly coded templates and instead focus on clean, optimized designs that are SEO-friendly and ready to perform. You’ll be involved in every step, with as many revisions as needed to ensure the design is exactly how you envision it.

                  Once the design is approved, our developers get to work. We develop the inner pages, install necessary frameworks, and ensure all coding is clean and efficient. We then rigorously test the site across multiple devices, browsers, and screen sizes to guarantee everything looks and functions smoothly. After thorough testing and optimization, your site is prepped to go live and ready to make an impact. We’ll keep monitoring its performance to make sure everything runs seamlessly.
